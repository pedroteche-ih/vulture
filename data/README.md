Data Attributes
These definitions come from the Movebank Attribute Dictionary, available at www.movebank.org/node/2381.

animal ID: An individual identifier for the animal, provided by the data owner. This identifier can be a ring number, a name, the same as the associated tag ID, etc. If the data owner does not provide an Animal ID, an internal Movebank animal identifier may sometimes be shown.
	example: 91876A, Gary
	same as: individual-local-identifier

attachment type: The way a tag is attached to an animal. Values are chosen from a controlled list:
	collar: The tag is attached by a collar around the animal's neck.
	glue: The tag is attached to the animal using glue.
	harness: The tag is attached to the animal using a harness.
	implant: The tag is placed under the skin of the an animal.
	tape: The tag is attached to the animal using tape.
	other: user specified

deploy on timestamp: The timestamp when the tag deployment started.
	example: 2008-08-30 18:00:00.000
	format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.sss
	units: UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) or GPS time, which is a few leap seconds different from UTC
	same as: deploy on date

deploy off timestamp: The timestamp when the tag deployment ended.
	example: 2009-10-01 12:00:00.000
	format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.sss
	units: UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) or GPS time, which is a few leap seconds different from UTC
	same as: deploy off date

duty cycle: Remarks associated with the duty cycle of a tag during the deployment, describing the times it is on/off and the frequency at which it transmits or records data.
	example: it turns off during the night
	units: Any units should be defined in the remarks.

event ID: An identifier for the set of information associated with each record or event in a data set. A unique event ID is assigned to every time-location or other time-measurement record in Movebank.
	example: 6340565
	units: none

ground speed: The estimated ground speed between consecutive locations.
	example: 7.22
	units: meters per second

heading: The direction in which the tag moved from this location to the subsequent location, calculated as the bearing between consecutive locations, in decimal degrees clockwise from north; for example, 0 = north, 90 = east, 180 = south.
	example: 315.88
	units: decimal degrees

latitude (decimal degree): The geographic longitude of a location along an animal track as estimated by the processed sensor data. Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it.
	example: -121.1761111
	units: decimal degrees, WGS84 reference system
	same as: location lat

latitude (UTM): The geographic longitude of the geographic center of a location along an animal track as estimated by the processed sensor data.
	example: 3628361.84012295
	units: meters, WGS84 reference system
	same as: utm northing

life stage: The age class or life stage of the animal at the beginning of the deployment. Can be years or months of age or terms such as "adult", "subadult" and "juvenile". Units should be defined in the values (e.g. "2 years").
	example: juvenile, adult
	units: Any units should be defined in the remarks.

local timestamp: The date and time a sensor measurement was taken in the time zone of the study reference location. The time zone for the study reference location is determined using the IANA Time Zone Database and a shapefile of these zones provided by efele.net.
	example: 2008-08-14 15:31:00.000
	format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.sss
	units: specific to the study time zone

longitude (decimal degree): The geographic longitude of a location along an animal track as estimated by the processed sensor data. Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it.
	example: -121.1761111

	radio transmitter: The sensor is a classical radio transmitter.
	bird ring: The animal is identified by a ring that has a unique ID.
	natural mark: The animal is identified by a natural marking.
	acceleration: The sensor collects acceleration data.
	other: The sensor is a type other than those described above.

	m: male
	f: female

study: The name of the study in Movebank in which data are stored.

study site: The name of the deployment site, for example a field station or colony.
	example: Pickerel Island North

study time zone: The time zone at the study reference location.
	example: Mountain Standard Time
	units: none

tag ID: A unique identifier for the tag, provided by the data owner. If the data owner does not provide a tag ID, an internal Movebank tag identifier may sometimes be shown.
	example: 2342, ptt_4532
	same as: tag local identifier

tag manufacturer name: The company or person that produced the tag.
	example: Holohil
	same as: manufacturer

tag mass: The mass of the tag.
	example: 24
	units: grams

tag readout method: The way the data are received from the tag. Values are chosen from a controlled list:
	satellite: Data are transferred via satellite.
	phone network: Data are transferred via a phone network, such as GSM or AMPS.
	other wireless: Data are transferred via another form of wireless data transfer, such as a VHF radio transmitter/receiver.
	tag retrieval: The tag must be physically retrieved in order to obtain the data.

taxon: The scientific name of the species on which the tag was deployed, as defined by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS, www.itis.gov). If the species name can not be provided, this should be the lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined and that is used in the ITIS taxonomy. Additional information can be provided using the term taxon detail.
	example: Buteo swainsoni
	same as: species, animal taxon, individual taxon canonical name

timestamp: The date and time a sensor measurement was taken.
	example: 2008-08-14 18:31:00.000
	format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.sss
	units: UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) or GPS time, which is a few leap seconds different from UTC

UTM zone: The UTM zone, selected based on the location of each event, used to convert locations from decimal degrees to UTM.
	example: 14N
	units: none

visible: Determines whether an event is visible on the Movebank Search map. Values are calculated automatically, with FALSE indicating that the event has been marked as an outlier by manually marked outlier or algorithm marked outlier. Allowed values are TRUE or FALSE.
